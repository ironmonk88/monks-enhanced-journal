# Version 10.1

v10 changes.  Lots has changed with this release.  With the addition of Journal Pages in Foundry I had to find a workaround.  I think ultimately the idea is that the Foundry Journal Entry represents an adventure book, whereas the Enhanced Journal pages are meant to be stand alone, interactive sheets.  The pages that MEJ uses aren't meant to be in a book, but are meant to stand alone.

I also updated the interface when creating an encounter from the Encounter sheet.  Instead of dragging the icon to the map where you want the encounter to take place, you now click the button and draw a Measured Template on the canvas to denote the area you want the monsters to be created in.  This should avoid all the icons piling up around each other and allow a randomization of positioning.

# Version 1.0.40

Added the Loot sheet.  Using this sheet you can drag players to the entry, if they aren't already there.  And split the money associated witht he Loot evenly between the characters.  You can also drag items from Loot onto the character icons to add the items to the characters inventory.  Like the Shop sheet, you can set it so that only the GM can control item distribution, players are allowed to take their own items, or they can make a request for the item.

Along with that you can now, in the settings, tell Enhanced Journals what you want to do with Quest or Encounter treasure.  You can have it create a new Loot Sheet or add the items to an old Loot sheet.  And there's integration with both Lootsheet and Merchant sheet to create actors and add the items to them.

The Shop sheet has also been updated, it will now try and deduct the money from the characters currency.  You can save the item using what currency it should be associated with.  So if something is worth 5 silver peices you can save the item price as `5 sp`.

Using the Shop, there is now a link for players to click on to buy the item, rather than relyign on them dragging and dropping to their character.

You can also now fill a Shop and a Loot sheet using a Rollable Table.

There's also now a Text only Journal Sheet.

Fixed an issue with the way items were being added to the Journal Entries.  I was adding them by just their ID, but discovered that if the item came from a compendium and the compendium was deleted, or if the item itself was deleted then the item would disappear from the Journal Entry.  I've changed it so that Journal Entries will keep a copy of the item data.  Now if the Journal Entry is added to a compendium, it can be transfered to a new world without data loss.  Because of these changes, be aware that Shopkeeper items will no longer automatically show up.  You need to right click on the image to import the items from the Actor.

Fixed an issue with saving user notes.

Added the option to Clear all content from a folder

Added option to double click on a Note or Token and display the text of a Journal Entry as a chat bubble instead of opening up the Journal Entry.  If the Journal Entry contains just a unordered list then one of the entries will ranbdomly be used.  If an ordered list is used, then it will select each item in sequence.  With no list, it will use the text in the Journal Entry.  Turn on this feature by selecting the "Show as Chat Bubble" setting.

# Version 1.0.25

Fixed an issue where items that no longer exist would crash a Shop.

Added drag and drop instrustions to the Place entry if there are no items.

# Version 1.0.22

Oh where to begin with this update.
The whole module has been rebuilt so instead of overwriting a Journal Entry, the browser part is it's own application and each Journal Type is it's own sheet now.  This gives greater flexibility for improvements int he future as well as inter-module communications.

I am expecting it to break somewhere as the changes are massive.

Things to note... that I'm sure doesn't cover everything, since I fixed things as I went.

Added the option to open the browser with the file menu collapsed.

Changed the Quests from having a status to having the option to "Show the quest to Players", "Show the Quest in the Notifications window", and "compete the quest".  I think this trims down the options nicely.

Added the option of players requesting a purchase, or dragging the item itself if the GM allows it.

Cleaned up the Journal Entries so that when shown to a player, they only reveal what they should reveal.

Changed slideshow text to allow for multiple texts to be added.

Added animations to the texts so they can fade in and out.

Encounters will let you drag and drop the group of monsters onto the scene.

You can create a Journal Link that opens up just the picture.  Instead of using @JournalEntry[9WdmdaZAzXSN1nih]{Test Picture} change it to @Picture[9WdmdaZAzXSN1nih]{Test Picture} and when you click on it, it will open just the image.

A new Journal Type has been added, Checklist.  This will let you create a list of items that you can check off.

And players can now purchase things from a shop.  Either by dragging it to their character themselves or requesting it from the GM.

# Version 1.0.21

Fixed the issue with rendering again.  Hopefully this is the last time, but I'm not holding my breath.
This time to fix issues with Trigger Happy.

Altered the editor with journals so you can have a lot more control over the content.  Adding in the menu bar gives you access to text colour, formatting, font, font sizes, etc.

Added the option of changing the background of a Journal Entry.  You can set it to a colour, or an image and control how that image is displayed.

Fixed an issue where opening an Actor in Enhanced Journal, then going back to a previous entry would stop the tabs from responding.

Changed the way Journal Entries are shared to players.  Now if the Journal Entry you're sharing has only text content or an image content, the tabs won't display.  If they're not needed, then they'll just get in the way.

Changed the way embedded Scenes are opened from a Journal Entry.  Before it would open up the Scene config dialog, now they'll actually activate that scene.

Added three more fonts.

Added the drop cap style.  Yes these are borrowed from the "Custom Journal" module that doesn't seem to work any more.

I swear this change is going to break something, and I apologize in advance for that happening.

Updated the journal entry dropdown for notes dropped on the canvas.  Before it was just a random jumble, now it's a list that works similar to the sidebar directory list.

# Version 1.0.6

Fixed an issue when creating a new slideshow, it was trying to access the currently active slide and since there wasn't one, it was causing an error.

Deleting a journal entry wasn't refreshing the page if it was open in the current tab.

If a DC was attempted to be added, but wasn't saved properly, the old DC was still there but causing errors.  I changed the code so that DCs aren't created the first time until the save button is pushed.

Dragging items onto the Quest entry wasn't working.

Journal Notes weren't cross linking to other notes.  Looks like the way the TextEditor was sending the information wasn't compatible with the Enhanced Journal.

Directory Searchign is fixed.
